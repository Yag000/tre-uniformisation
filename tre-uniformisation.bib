   abstract = {A uniformisation of a binary relation is a functional relation contained in it, with the same domain. The uniformisation problem asks whether such a uniformisation can be defined in a given formalism.We solve this problem in the context of regular relations over finite words, for the fragment FO2[<] of First-Order Logic with two variables: we provide an algorithm that decides if a given regular relation over finite words admits a uniformisation definable in FO2[<].The paper provides a new representation of languages definable in FO2[<], which can be used for the decidability of other problems involving this formalism, e.g. the problem of separability of two regular languages by a language definable in FO2[<].},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Introduction. In this paper we solve the decision problem of a certain second-order mathematical theory and apply it to obtain a large number of decidability results. The method of solution involves the development of a theory of automata on infinite trees-a chapter in combinatorial mathematics which may be of independent interest. Let I = \{0, 1\}, and denote by T the set of all words (finite sequences) on E. Let ro: T-> T and rl: T-T be, respectively, the successor functions ro(x) = xO and r1(x) = xl, x E T. Our main result is that the (monadic) second-order theory of the structure <T, ro, r1> of two successor functions is decidable. This answers a question raised by Biichi [1]. It turns out that this result is very powerful and many difficult decidability results follow from it by simple reductions. The decision procedures obtained by this method are elementary recursive (in the sense of Kalmar). The applications include the following. (Whenever we refer, in this paper, to second-order theories, we mean monadic second-order; weak second-order means quantification restricted to finite subsets of the domain.) The second-order theory of countable linearly ordered sets is proved decidable. As a corollary we get that the weak second-order theory of arbitrary linearly ordered sets is decidable; a result due to Lauchli [9] which improves on a result of Ehrenfeucht [5]. In [4] Ehrenfeucht announced the decidability of the first-order theory of a unary function. We prove that the second-order theory of a unary function with a count-able domain is decidable. Also, the weak second-order theory of a unary function with an arbitrary domain is decidable. There are also applications to point set topology. Let CD be Cantor's dis-continuum (i.e., \{O, 1\}O with the product topology). Let F, be the lattice of all subsets of CD which are denumerable unions of closed sets, and let LC be the sublattice of all closed subsets of CD. The first-order theory of the lattice Fa, with LC as a distinguished sublattice, is decidable. Similar results hold for the real line with the usual topology. This answers in the affirmative Grzegorczyk's question [8] whether},

   abstract = {Many of the important concepts and results of conventional finite automata theory are developed for a generalization in which finite algebras take the place of finite automata. The standard closure theorems are proved for the class of sets "recogniz-able" by finite algebras, and a generalization of Kleene's regularity theory is presented. The theorems of the generalized theory are then applied to obtain a positive solution to a decision problem of second-order logic. 1. I n t r o d u c t i o n Let us presuppose that the reader understands what we mean by "gen-eralized finite automaton". With this presupposition, the results presented here are easily summarized (cf. T h a t c h e r and Wright [ 19]) by saying that conventional finite automata theory goes through for the g e n e r a l i z a t i o n-and it goes t h r o u g h quite neatly! O u r presupposition is also simple to dispose of: A generalized finite automaton is a finite abstract algebra in the sense of Birkhoff [ 1 ] ; it is a finite set A together with operationsJ~, • • • , fn on A. (The algebras considered here are not quite as general as those considered by Birkhoff [ 1]. We allow only a finite n u m b e r of operations (the infinite case will be considered in a later paper) and each operation is a function from A '~ into A for some m. Birkhoff required only that some subset of UA i be specified as the domain of each operation, a generaliza-i tion which does not appear in his Foreword on Algebra in [2].) T h e most commonly used definition (cf. Rabin and Scott [ 14]) describes a finite automaton with input alphabet ~ as a quadruple d = (A, M, a0, AF), where A is a finite set, the set of states; M is a function from ~ × A into A, the direct transition function; ao ~ A is the initial state and Ar C A is the set o f final states.
